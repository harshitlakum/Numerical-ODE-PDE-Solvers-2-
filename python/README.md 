# Python Codes for Numerical ODE/PDE and Multidimensional Integration

This folder contains Python implementations for various numerical methods and demonstrations:

## Scripts

- **euler_logistic_adaptive.py**  
  Solves the logistic growth initial value problem using explicit Euler method with adaptive step size. Plots both the solution and the time-varying step size.

- **rk4_linear_system.py**  
  Solves a linear system of ODEs using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.

- **implicit_midpoint_vs_euler.py**  
  Solves a stiff linear ODE system using both the implicit midpoint method and explicit Euler, and compares both to the exact solution.

- **mc_integral_multidim.py**  
  Estimates the integral of a high-dimensional function over the unit cube using Monte Carlo integration, and compares with the exact value for increasing dimensions.

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib

Install with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
