# MATLAB Codes for Numerical ODE/PDE and Multidimensional Integration

This folder contains MATLAB implementations for various numerical methods and demonstrations:

## Scripts

- **euler_logistic_adaptive.m**  
  Solves the logistic growth initial value problem using explicit Euler with adaptive step size. Plots the solution and adaptive step size over time.

- **rk4_linear_system.m**  
  Solves a linear system of ODEs using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.

- **implicit_midpoint_vs_euler.m**  
  Solves a stiff linear ODE system using both the implicit midpoint method and explicit Euler, and compares both to the exact solution.

- **mc_integral_multidim.m**  
  Estimates the integral of a high-dimensional function over the unit cube using Monte Carlo integration, and compares with the exact value for increasing dimensions.

## Usage

Open any script in MATLAB or Octave and run it, for example:
```matlab
run('euler_logistic_adaptive.m')
